  <h1>FAQ Questions I Made Up</h1>
  
<div class="theprocess">
  Things I would have asked myself that you might not have asked because you thought it was a stupid question or because you don't know how to contact me...so I asked for you. <br><br>

 <p style='font-weight:600'>Why did you do last name + first name for your domain name instead of first name + last name? 
  </p>
  <p> It's a play on words with my name. Zhao in Chinese can also mean find or look for depending on the intonation, so you can read it as “Zhao, Anna” or “looking for Anna?” if you want to include the "me" (technically spelled ma, but same pronunciation, so *shrug*, close enough). <br> If you don't speak Chinese, you've probly never pronounced my last name correctly, so you can pretend to let it mean whatever you want, since truth doesn't matter anyways.  </p>

  <p style="font-weight:600">What is something you don't understand?</p>
  <p>Why red delicious apples still exist</p>

  <p style="font-weight:600"> Why does each page have a different look to it? The incongruity is disconcerting. </p>
  <p>Yeaaa, so I made this myself and basically, I design things like Homer makes cars...At least I was broke to start with, so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_Brother,_Where_Art_Thou%3F" target='_blank'>no harm done</a>.</p>

  <p style="font-weight:600"> Why didn't you just use Squarespace?  Seriously, the incongruity is disconcerting. </p>
  <p>Life Rule #3.  Don't pay for things that you don't need to pay for.</p>

  <p style="font-weight:600">Wtf does #TrustTheProcess mean?</p>
   <p>This is what I think of when I hear the words "the process": </p><a class="example-image-link" href="images/fulls/TTP.png" data-lightbox="embiid"><img class="blogphoto" src="images/thumbs/TTP.png" alt="image-1" style="position:relative; left:50%; margin-left:-106.5px;" /></a>

  <p style="font-weight:600">What's the secret to life?</p>
  <p>Low expectations</p>

  <p style="font-weight:600">What are your life goals?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Play basketball with Obama</li>
    <li>Be friends with JK Rowling</li>
    <li>Make Hogwarts out of Legos...like this: </li>
    <a class="example-image-link" href="images/fulls/hogwarts.jpg" data-lightbox="hogwarts"><img class="blogphoto" src="images/thumbs/hogwarts.jpg" alt="image-1" style="position:relative; left:50%; margin-left:-160px;"/></a>
  
    <p>Check out Alice Finch's entire album <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/88574960@N02/sets/72157632858317817/"  target="_blank">here</a>.  The detail is amazing. </p>    
  </ul>

  <p>Yes, I realize that I don't know the secret to life.</p>

  <p style="font-weight:600">What do you want to be in 5 years?</p>
  <p>5'9" and under 30. Or at least look young enough for student discounts.</p>

  <p style="font-weight:600">Were your projects pages supposed to open to another page because I couldn't open anything. </p>
  <p style="font-weight:600"><a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html" target="_blank">FTFY.</a></p>
  <p>Yes, I realize that if that link were actually the solution for you, you probably wouldn't have been able to open it...anndd that if you knew what FTFY stood for, you wouldn't have needed the link.</p>

  <p style="font-weight:600">What's with the hat vs boa thing?</p>
  <p>I'm sorry, we've reached the question limit.</p>

  <p style="font-weight:600">How many watermelons do you usually buy at one go?</p>
  <p>It depends on how many I have at home when I go and where I'm living.  I like to have one backup at all times, but if I'm living in NYC, just one...because carrying a watermelon is a both arm exercise.  I'm not trying to be like this guy.  </p> <img src="images/groceries.gif" style="position:relative; left:50%; margin-left:-187.5px; padding: 15px;">

  <p style="font-weight:600">Can you get diabetes from eating too much watermelon?</p>
  <p>Wait this is a stupid question that I wanted answered. </p>

  <p style="font-weight:600">I really like the font. </p>
  <p>Why, thank you.  I spent a lonnng time debating between this and Oxygen and consulting un-paid font snob friends. I'm so glad you noticed. </p>

  <p style="font-weight:600">I don't like the font. </p>
  <p>Go to hungry and photos pages and look at the pictures then? </p>

  <p style="font-weight:600">Favorite books and movies?</p>
  <p>(Ok so I just wanted more people to appreciate these.)</p>
  <p><u>Books</u> (After Harry Potter, of course.): The Glass Castle, Le Petit Prince, Nothing to Envy, The Kite Runner, The Help, Roald Dahl</p>
  <p><u>Movies</u>: The Imitation Game, Interstellar, Deadpool, 3 Idiots, The Little Prince, Temple Grandin, Mean Girls, anything with Sandra Bullock</p>
  <p><u>TV</u> (I know you didn't ask, but you didn't ask any of these): Parks and Recreation, Arrested Development, Breaking Bad, Sherlock</p>
