  <h1>Stupid FAQ Questions I Made Up</h1>

<div class="theprocess">
 <strong>Why did you do last name + first name for your domain name instead of first name + last name? 
  </strong>
  <p> It's a Chinese pun I made up. Zhao in Chinese can also mean find or look for depending on the intonation, so you can read it as “Zhao, Anna” or “looking for Anna?”...and if you want to stretch it, “Found Anna” but you technically need another character at the end.  If you don't speak Chinese, you've probly never pronounced my last name correctly, so you can pretend to let it mean whatever you want, since truth doesn't matter anyways. </p>

  <strong> Why does each page have a different look to it? The incongruity is disconcerting. </strong>
  <p>Yea, I made this myself and basically, I design things like Homer makes cars.  And I wanted practice.  At least I was broke to start with, so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_Brother,_Where_Art_Thou%3F">no harm done</a> .</p>

  <strong> Why didn't you just use Squarespace?  Seriously, the incongruity is disconcerting. </strong>
  <p>Life Rule #1.  Don't pay for things that you don't need to pay for.</p>

  <strong>Wtf does #TrustTheProcess mean?</strong>
   <p> <a class="example-image-link" href="images/TTP.png" data-lightbox="embiid"><img class="blogphoto" src="images/TTP_thumb.png" alt="image-1" /></a></p>

  <strong>What's the secret to life?</strong>
  <p>Low expectations</p>

  <strong>What are your life goals?</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Play basketball with Obama</li>
    <li>Be friends with JK Rowling</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Yes, I realize that I don't know the secret to life.</p>

  <strong>What do you want to be in 5 years?</strong>
  <p>Under 30. Or at least look young enough for student discounts.</p>
