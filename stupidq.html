  <h1>Stupid FAQ Questions I Made Up</h1>

<div class="theprocess">
 <strong>Why did you do last name + first name for your domain name instead of first name + last name? 
  </strong>
  <p> It's a play on words with my name. Zhao in Chinese can also mean find or look for depending on the intonation, so you can read it as “Zhao, Anna” or “looking for Anna?” if you want to include the "me" (technically spelled ma, but same pronunciation, so *shrug*, close enough). <br> If you don't speak Chinese, you've probly never pronounced my last name correctly, so you can pretend to let it mean whatever you want, since truth doesn't matter anyways.  </p>

  <strong> Why does each page have a different look to it? The incongruity is disconcerting. </strong>
  <p>Yea, I made this myself and basically, I design things like Homer makes cars.  And I wanted practice.  At least I was broke to start with, so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_Brother,_Where_Art_Thou%3F">no harm done</a> .</p>

  <strong> Why didn't you just use Squarespace?  Seriously, the incongruity is disconcerting. </strong>
  <p>Life Rule #3.  Don't pay for things that you don't need to pay for.</p>

  <strong>Wtf does #TrustTheProcess mean?</strong>
   <p>This: <a class="example-image-link" href="images/fulls/TTP.png" data-lightbox="embiid"><img class="blogphoto" src="images/thumbs/TTP.png" alt="image-1" /></a></p>

  <strong>What's the secret to life?</strong>
  <p>Low expectations</p>

  <strong>What are your life goals?</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Play basketball with Obama</li>
    <li>Be friends with JK Rowling</li>
    <li>Make Hogwarts out of Legos...like this: <a class="blogphoto" data-flickr-embed="true" data-lightbox="lego" title="Hogwarts" href="images/fulls/hogwarts.jpg"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8251/8508642261_a41cb5d2dc.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Hogwarts"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </li><br>
    Check out Alice Finch's entire album <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/88574960@N02/sets/72157632858317817/"  target="_blank">here</a>–seriously.  It's amazing.
  </ul>

  <p>Yes, I realize that I don't know the secret to life.</p>

  <strong>What do you want to be in 5 years?</strong>
  <p>5'9" and under 30. Or at least look young enough for student discounts.</p>

  <strong>Favorite books and movies?</strong>
  <p>(Ok so I just didn't have anywhere to put these without making another tab and it always makes me sad when not enough people, ie everybody, appreciates something as much as it should be appreciated.)</p>
  <p>Some Books (After Harry Potter, of course.): The Glass Castle, Le Petit Prince, Nothing to Envy, The Kite Runner, The Help, Roald Dahl</p>
  <p>Some obvious and not obvious movies: The Imitation Game, Interstellar, Deadpool, 3 Idiots, The Little Prince, Temple Grandin, Mean Girls, anything with Sandra Bullock</p>
  <p>TV (I know you didn't ask): Parks and Recreation, Arrested Development, Breaking Bad, Sherlock</p>
