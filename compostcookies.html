    <h2>Milk Bar Compost Cookies</h2>
    <h3>Modified to be not too sweet...ðŸ˜…</h3>
    <div class="theprocess">        
        <p>This is really for me so I don't have to have the Milk Bar cook book with me. There've been a lot of mods<br> 
        <p>I'm a big fan of Christina Tosi and wanna meet her but most of the Milk Bar things I've had are way too sweet for me.  You can find her original recipe on her site if you create an account/buy her recipe book (highly rec).
        </p>
        <p>If you've used her recipe before, I've listed the mods including exclusions.
					The dough's kind of hard to get to stick together because I put so much other stuff in it, so fair warning you're gonna have to do work to make a ball. </p>
				<br>
				<p>Everything listed in grams bc you should weigh your ingredients.  Way more accurate and also less work just dumping stuff in a bigger container til you hit a number lol.  Get a scale.
				</p>
				
        <strong><h3>Ingredients</h3> </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>2 sticks unsalted butter at room temp. Make sure the butter is soft enough and not solid or you'll get chunks 
					</li>        
          <li>150g sourdough starter discard^</li>                
          <li>135g white sugar (orig 200g)</li>
          <li>115g brown sugar (orig 150g)</li>
					<li>No corn syrup </li>
          <hr>
					<li>1 egg</li>
					<li>1/2 teaspoon (2g) vanilla extract^#</li>
					<hr>
					<li>225g bread flour^^</li>
					<li>1/2 teaspoon (2g) baking powder</li>
					<li>1/4 teaspoon (1.5g) baking powder</li>
					<li>4g salt</li>
					<hr>
          <li>100 g (dark/semisweet etc) chocolate chips^^^ </li>
          <li>150 g butterscotch chips^^^</li>
          <li>90g dark chocolate pretzels^^^^</li>
          
          <li>125g oatmeal (orig 40g) ^^^^^ </li>
          <li>80g cornflake crunch* </li>
					<li>I skip the Graham Crust. I think it makes it a bit hard iirc/also being lazy bc I couldn't taste it enough for the effort</li>
					<li>I also skip the 5g of ground coffee bc it completely changes the flavor.  I don't like coffee but one of my friends swears by this ingredient.</li>
					<hr>
          <li>70g potato chips (orig 50g)^^^^^^</li>
          <li>50g pretzels </li>

					<hr>          
        </ul>

        <p>Notes:
          ^I always use at 7-14 days old just bc I imagine freshly fed makes it bread like? and too old = maybe adds actual sour flavor. I've never been able to taste the starter and it adds moisture/chewiness. I add this in the first step to get it mixed in. This is the most optional ingredient. I just didn't want to throw away so much discard so regularly.
					<br>
					^#Type of vanilla extract doesn't matter.  Serious eats did a whole experiment on how it doesn't matter if you're baking and now I use the fake cheap kind you can get at Walmart for like $2 for a decently big bottle lol.  
          <br>
          *Cornflake crunch isn't in the original recipe, but a diff MB recipe and I borrowed from. It's basically 170g of cornflakes mashed and mixed w/40g milk powder, 40g sugar, 4g salt and a stick of melted butter, baked at 275g for 20 min. Delicious addicting snack and it'll stay fresh in the fridge for a lonnggg time.
					<br>
					^^Can you use AP flour? Sure but somewhere in the book, she mentions bread flour since it's chewier and this recipe is a lot of work so I've never tried AP flour to save a buck for all this work.
					<br>
          ^^^I've started chopping my choco/butterscotch chips.  Strat from <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab-best-chocolate-chip-cookie-recipe" target="_blank">Kenji Lopez Alt's CCC recipe</a>. I'll also chop random chocolate--my fav version has prob been this chocolate I got in Amsterdam that has stroopwafel in it alas lol. Orig recipe calls for 150g mini CC but I cut it bc of the dark choc pretzels  
					
					<br>
          ^^^^I like the dark chocolate pretzels at trader joes.  RIP the dark choco pretzel thins 
          <br>
					^^^^^ Yes this is a huge increase in oatmeal.  This is the not too sweet version and a reg oatmeal cookie has at least 2x as much oatmeal.  You won't notice it if you dont like oatmeal.
					<br>
         ^^^^^^I haven't found the brand of chip to matter--generic Kroger brand is pretty good, but they rec thick kettle cooked ones. I would not rec using TerraChips...just trust me lol.

        <h3>Instructions (from the book)</h3>
    <p>Combine the <strong>sourdough starter</strong>, butter, sugars in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and cream together on medium-high for 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, add the egg and vanilla, and beat for 7 to 8 minutes.</p>

    <p>Reduce the speed to low and add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix just until the dough comes together, no longer than 1 minute. (Do not walk away from the machine during this step, or you will risk over mixing the dough.) Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula. </p>

    <p>Still on low speed, add the chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, graham crust, oats and coffee, and mix just until incorporated, about 30 seconds. Add the potato chips and pretzels and paddle, still on low speed, until just incorporated. Be careful not to over mix or youâ€™ll break too many of the pretzels or potato chips. You deserve a pat on the back if one of your cookies bakes off with a whole pretzel standing up in the center.</p>

    <p>Original: Using a 2 3/4-ounce ice cream scoop (or a 1/3 cup measure), portion out the dough onto a parchment-lined sheet pan. Pat the tops of the cookie dough domes flat. Wrap the sheet pan tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to 1 week. Do not bake your cookies from room temperature â€” they will not bake properly.

		Mod: 65g balls that I flatten into pucks makes about 24 cookies.  I prefer smaller tho and aim for 50g pucks that I freeze and then bake from frozen for 16-18 min at 375F. They don't really spread in this scenario and 3 finger widths between is good enough.	
		</p>
		<p><strong>STRONG RECOMMENDATION</strong>: I highly rec you freeze any cookies you arent eating that day immediately because there is a noticeable quality diff in freshness. Nobody likes stale chips/cookies/pretzels/cereal so freeze them. </p>

    <p>Heat the oven to 375 degrees.</p>

    <p>Arrange the chilled dough a minimum of 4 inches apart on parchment- or silpat-lined sheet pans. Bake for 18 minutes. The cookies will puff, crackle and spread. After 18 minutes, they should be very faintly browned on the edges yet still bright yellow in the center. Give them an extra minute or so if thatâ€™s not the case.</p>
